Concrete is one of the most widely used materials in construction. As a result, it is a frequently studied material in civil engineering. One of the most important properties of concrete is it's compressive strength. This notebook will seek to analyze and understand a dataset that contains information about different concrete mixtures and their resulting compressive strengths.

The dataset used in this analysis contains data on 1030 different concrete mixtures. For each of the concrete mixtures, there are eight different variables recorded that will be considered in the comparative analysis. The first seven variables are the "ingredients" or the amounts of cement, slag, ash, water, superplastic, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate each measured in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3). The eighth variable that is considered in the analysis is the age of the concrete mixture when it's set in days. The strength of the concrete, which is the response, is measured in MPa.
